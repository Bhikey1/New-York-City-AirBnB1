It can be seen from the chart that the most expensive neighbourhood groups are Manhattan and Brooklyn and they are the most busiest. Also, the best 
reviewed areas are Queens, Bronx, Staten Island. However, they are less patronized compared to expensive areas. This shows that customers prefer 
high priced neighbourhood groups than best reviewed ones.
