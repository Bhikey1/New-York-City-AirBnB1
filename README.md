### Tasks
1. What can we learn about different areas and from predictions ex. location and price, location and reviews?
It can be seen from the chart that the most expensive neighbourhood groups are Manhattan and Brooklyn and they are the most busiest. Also, the best 
reviewed areas are Queens, Bronx, Staten Island. However, they are less patronized compared to expensive areas. This shows that customers prefer 
high priced neighbourhood groups than best reviewed ones.

2. Which areas are the busiest and why?

The second busiest area is Brooklyn and it is also surrounded by many attraction centres of culture, entertainment and more. The third busiest area is Queens.

3. Is there any noticeable difference  of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for that?

are located there. For example, Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Central Park. Furthermore, it is surrounded by some of 
top museums in New York City. Brooklyn, it is filled with art, culture, entertainment, food and more, It attracts everyone, mostly families and couples.
